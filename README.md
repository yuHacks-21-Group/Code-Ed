Welcome to Code-Ed's GitHub page! This is our project for yuHacks 2021!

# Description
Introducing Code-Ed, the One-Stop-Shop for beginners to learn the fundamentals of programming! 
Have you ever felt stuck while programming because you felt like you don't know the basics or the syntax of the language? 
Then Code-Ed is the place for you! Through the use of the YouTube API, HTML/CSS/JS and Repl.it, 
we have created an All-In-One platform for beginners to learn and practice programming fundamentals. 
The best part is, you never have to leave the webpage.

# Tech
Code-Ed was created in the Repl.it online IDE using pure HTML/CSS/JS. That's right, NO FRAMEWORKS!
We integrated the YouTube API to capture the most up-to-date relavent videos about key concepts 
in programming. 
We built a Repl.it IDE right into our webpage so that the user can be faced with challenges to
check their understanding of the content that they just learned. Plus, there is also a Playgrounds 
tab where the user can have fun with their new skills and develop right in Code-Ed!

# People
Code-Ed was made over the course 24 hours by Joshua Ong and Nathan DeGoey! 
We are very proud of the final Code-Ed product. It was a long 24 hours, but we did it!
